# Reinforcement Learning

## What is Reinforcement Learning?
<b>Reinforcement learning focuses on teaching agents through trial and error</b>

### Concepts:
There are four fundamental concepts that underpin most RL projects. These are:
1. <b>Agent</b>: the actor operating within the environment, it is usually governed by a policy(a rule that decides what action to take)
2. <b>Environment</b>: the world in which the agent can operate in
3. <b>Action</b>: the agent can do something within the environment known as an action
4. <b>Reward and Observations</b>: in return the agent receives a reward and a view of what the environment looks like after acting on it.

### Stable Baseline
Stable baseline is a Python library that makes it easier to get up and running with
Reinforcement Learning. 

It is originally based off the OpenAI Baselines package but has additional features
that makes it easy to get started with RL.
